* we measure order of growth of time taken by a function or program in terms of input size
* Does n't depend upon programming language, machine and test cases.
* While we do worst case analysis , its algorithmic specific not test cases specific
* we dont have to implement algorithm & then analyse/measure time using asymptotic analysis
   -- Process of asymptotic analysis --
* we get an expression of time taken by code in terms of input size
