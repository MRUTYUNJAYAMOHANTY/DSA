* Asymptotic notations are mathematical notations to represent order of growth of any   
   mathematical  function
* Basically 3 major types of Asymptotic notations
   1. Big O notation :O(n):Exact or Upper : linear or less than linear
      e.g 
       C1n + C2
        can be written as O(n) or O(n^2)
        In Big o notation , we can write n or higher than n like n^2,nlogn..
      - mostly used in real world / upper bound  
   2. Theta : Exact
      - takes constant time
      - Θ(1) ,O(1)
      - mostly used in real world / exact bound
   3. Omega: Exact or lower
       - either constant or any value higher than constant
       - Ω(1),Ω(n)
       - very less used in real world
