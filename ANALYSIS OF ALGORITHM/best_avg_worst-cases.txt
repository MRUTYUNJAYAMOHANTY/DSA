* All initialization takes constant amount of time (C)
* return something is also constant(C)
* May be a statemnt execution a liner number of time
* checking condition in a loop also linear
* increment happening in a loop also linear

                    ----   ---- 

* type of i/p size
* Best case : constant : - minimum order of growth of an algorithm
                         - its bogus we dont require the best.

* Average case : linear : - Time taken for every input 
                          - we are not sure what would be i/p type and size 
                          - We have to either make certain assumption or in ideal case to know the 
                            exact i/p
                          - impractical many times
                          
* Worst case : linear : mostly used in real world
